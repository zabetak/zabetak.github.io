        <p>The main objective of my thesis was to study and develop efficient
          algorithms for managing big volumes of Semantic Web (RDF) data using
          cloud technologies. The storage and retrieval of RDF data using the
          Amazon cloud and the Hadoop framework are the main axis of this study.
        </p>
        <p>The focus is towards query optimization where the developed
          algorithms are able to provide massively parallel execution plans
          ideal for distributed systems and multi-core architectures.</p>

            https://team.inria.fr/oak/projects/cliquesquare/</a></p>
        <p>CliqueSquare is a system for storing and querying large RDF graphs
          relying on Hadoop’s distributed file system (HDFS) and Hadoop’s
          MapReduce open-source implementation. It provides a novel partitioning
          and storage scheme that permits 1-level joins to be evaluated locally
          using efficient map-only joins.</p>
        <p>In addition, CliqueSquare is equipped with a unique optimization
          algorithm based on graphs and cliques capable of generating highly
          parallelizable flat query plans relying on n-ary equality joins.</p>
        <p>This project was part of my PHD thesis. I was involved in every
          aspect of the project (research, design, implementation). </p>
